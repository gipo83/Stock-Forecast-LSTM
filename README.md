# Stock-Forecast-LSTM
The goal of this project is generating a LSTM neural network with Keras able to predict stock prices based on past data only.

We consider the input dataset with these features: Open, Low, High, Close, Volume, Name.

To start import download project and import library:
'''
import stockForecastLSTM
'''

Some informations about preprocessing are:
'remove feature'
'''

'''

This library will add all follow technical indicators to dataset: EMA, Stochastic, ROC, RSI, AccDO, MACD, Williams, Disparity 5, Disparity 10


Now you can do some choices as follow example:
